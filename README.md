# March Machine Learning Mania 2017
This was a competition on Kaggle.com to successfully predict the outcomes of the 2017 NCAA Basketball Tournament. All of the data I used, as well as my submissions, are in the .csv files. The Jupyter notebook gives the actual model, and is meant to be readable. I used Python (mostly pandas and sklearn) to do the analysis.

This was my first real project in data science, and as such there's nothing too sophisticated. Will update after the competition is over.
